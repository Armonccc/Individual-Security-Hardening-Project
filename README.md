# Individual Security Hardening Project
Individual Project for CIS 221 - Server Security Hardening, Real-World Threats, Policies, and Incident Response

**Project: Individual Server Hardening**

Independently implemented and demonstrated fundamental security hardening techniques on a server environment. The project involved:

•	Configuring Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and fail2ban software to detect and mitigate unauthorized access attempts.

•	Developing a security policy to establish structured defence practices.

•	Creating an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to ensure preparedness for security breaches.

•	Analyzing and discussing common malware threats and their potential system impact.

•	Managing file permissions and modifying system directories to further strengthen server security.

This project provided practical experience in server hardening, security policy development, and proactive threat mitigation.
